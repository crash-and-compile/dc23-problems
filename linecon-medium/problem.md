# Linecon

Thousands of people have shown up for DefCon but registration is running a little behind schedule.
Let's buy a bunch of booze and start LineCon!

Everyone can afford to buy 1 drink (*cough* Lite beer *cough*), but friendly hackers can join together
to buy something better. Since everyone is standing in a line, they are only going to coordinate with
their neighbors (no skipping over the sad, anti-social guy between the two of you).

## INPUT
The input will be a number of problems, each on their own line. Each line consists of the number of
waiting attendees followed by a series of numbers corresponding to the number of people required to
buy premium booze. In the first sample, there are bottles that take 2, 3 and 4 people to buy.

## The Output
Print on separate lines the total number of potential booze combinations. In the sample, you would
end up with (1, 1, 1, 1, 1), (2, 1, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1, 1), (2, 3), etc.

## Sample input
	5 2 3 4
	13 4

## Sample output
	15
	36
