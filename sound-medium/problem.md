# Sound

This year, we're big on senses. Let's play with sound, but this is now a
medium problem. I'll stream you the contents of an audio file. You have
to tell me how many seconds the audio runs. All audio samples are 2Hz
with a sample rate of 44100, 4 bits per sample and a single harmonic.


## INPUT
The input will consist of a binary stream

## The Output
Print the number of seconds for the sample to the nearest second

## Sample input

## Sample output
