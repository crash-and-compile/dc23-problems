# N-Queens

The 8 queens problem is a classic algorithm problem. Given an 8x8 chess board,
you have to place 8 queens on the board such that no two queens are attacking
each other. We'll use an arbitrary number of queens on an arbitrary size board.

For the easy version of this problem, I'll give you a board. You tell me the
maximum number of queens that could be placed on that board such that no two
queens are attacking each other.

## INPUT
The input will consist of a chess board represented by X and _ characters. 
The X is a black space, the _ is a white space. A blank line indicates the start of a new board.

## The Output
Print the maximum number of queens that can be placed on the board without
failing the requirements
