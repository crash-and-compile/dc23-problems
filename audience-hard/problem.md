# Audience Participation (Hard)

Crash and Compile is no longer a spectator sport: for this problem, we involve the spectators!
You must find someone in the audience to code the solution *FOR* you.

Problem is simple. You must provide code that will add all prime numbers for a give list.

RULES:

- The audience member picks the language and must do all typing, but are *NOT* allowed on stage. So, word to the wise, pick someone with a computer.
- You may send someone who is not on stage out to find someone else to be the participant. (ie. find audience member, tell them to go get Bob, Bob writes code and gives to you).
- You must remain on stage at all times.


## INPUT
The input will consist of a list of numbers, one per line.

## The Output
Print the sum of all primes in that list.

## Sample input
	2
	7

	4
	8

	24
