# Audience Participation (Easy)

Crash and Compile is no longer a spectator sport: for this problem, we involve the spectators!
You must find someone in the audience to code the solution *FOR* you.

Problem is simple. You must add three numbers together.

RULES:

- You pick the language, but the audience member MUST tell you what to type. You MIGHT want to pick a language they know, but you can also make suggestions.
- All participants must be 21 or older, we will check there ID before they are allowed on stage.
- Drinking is left up to the participant, but they must provide their own libations if they plan on drinking.
