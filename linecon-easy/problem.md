# Linecon

Thousands of people have shown up for DefCon but registration is running a little behind schedule.
Let's buy a bunch of booze and start LineCon!

Everyone can afford to buy 1 drink (*cough* Lite beer *cough*), but friendly people can join together
to buy something better.

## INPUT
The input will be a series of lines, each specifying the the number of waiting attendees followed by
a series of numbers corresponding to the number of people required to buy premium booze. In the sample,
the first problem uses bottles that take 3 people to buy and those that take 5 people to buy.

## The Output
Print on separate lines the minimum bottles purchased if everyone works together in a hacker utopia.

## Sample input
	14058 3 5
	10288 9 4 2 6

## Sample output
	2812
	1144
